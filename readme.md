# A collection of resources for 42 students to learn more faster

NO SOLUTION CODE PROVIDED - the goal is to enable you to figure out more faster, not do it for you.

Instead, best practices, strategies of attack, major concepts, and testing scripts are linked.

We can't stop you from copy pasting code.  But seriously, we shouldn't have to stop you from that 
anyway.  Who learns from copy pasta?  We are not machines (yet) and the matrix is not here (yet),
it's our job to make that happen!  So get to crackin'.
