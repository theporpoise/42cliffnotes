# A collection of resources for 42 students to learn more faster

NO SOLUTION CODE PROVIDED 

Instead, best practices, strategies of attack, major concepts, and testing scripts are linked.

How it works:

As of now, we do not believe in a single over-reaching definitive guide.  In fact, it was mentioned that a useful part of the 
whole "guide" idea is actually writing one up yourself!  So instead of trying to edit a "master guide" for each project,
we will collect a bunch of different guides from any contributor who submits.  This way there's a chance for everyone
to contribute, and we'll get a much better collection of ideas and strategies!

Who knows, as we evolve we may provide summaries of the differences between different guides, or point out interesting
implementations (like have a *INTERESTING* tag on unique approaches to project problems).  This way users can browse 
and get the thought process behind different potential implementations for solving a problem.  Now that's what I call
really covering the map in terms of knowledge search!
